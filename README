Overview
========

IFrameFactory helps addons to create and re-use frames. It creates the frames
when needed and keeps a list of unused frames. Each client that wants to use
IFrameFactory needs to register an interface under the addon name and a frame
class name. This interface needs to have a :Create() and a :Destroy() function,
these are used to create and destroy the frames. Destroy is maybe a bit
misleading as the frames can't be destroyed, the client just should clean up
the frame so it can be stored in a list for later re-use.


Public API
==========


IFrameFactory:Register(addon, class, iface)

Registers a interface 'iface' under the adodn name 'addon' and frame class name
'class'.



frame = IFrameFactory:Create(addon, class)

Creates a new frame using the :Create() function from the interface or takes a
frame from the unused list and returns it. If a new frame needs to be created,
it generates a name and calls iface:Create(name) and expects to get a new frame
object.



IFrameFactory:Destroy(addon, class, frame)

Passes 'frame' to the iface:Destroy() function and expects to get a clean
frame. Then the clean frame is saved in a list to be re-used later.
